Welcome to Blades documentation
================================

.. FEDn documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


This is a typical paragraph.  An indented literal block follows.

>>> pip install blades

This text has returned to the indentation of the first paragraph,
is outside of the literal block, and is therefore treated as an
ordinary paragraph.
